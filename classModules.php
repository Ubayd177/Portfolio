      <h1>Computer Systems and Architecture</h1>
      <p>This module helped me gain fundamental understanding of basic computer components such as the CPU and the RAM and how they operate and communicate internally and how multiple computers communicate in a network. Along with this I gained experience in MIPS assembly language.</p>

      <h1>Procedural Programming</h1>
      <p>This module taught me the procedural programming paradigm in Java. I learnt about practices to avoid when using this paradigm and practices a programmer should follow such as usage of passing variables between methods via parameters. I developed a chat bot which can hold up a basic conversation with topics of interest.</p>

      <h1>Logic and discrete Structures</h1>
      <p>This module assisted me to gain experience in discrete mathematics through constructing formal structures such a propositions, logic gates and box proofs. I developed multiple box proofs for natural deduction in examinations and lab exercises.</p>

      <h1>Professional and Research Practice </h1>
      <p>This module was important for me personally to boost my experience in working in a team, giving me confidence in delegating tasks as a co-leader, learning the format of essay writing with citations and helped me improve my presenting skills with a group research presentation about e-waste. </p>
